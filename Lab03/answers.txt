6. Create constructor method:
- No, JAVA doesn't allow this
10. Working with method overloading:
- To pass an arbitrary number of parameters, Java use:
addDigitalVideoDisc(DigitalVideoDisc ... args)
- It works the same way as the array parameter, just different syntax
- I prefer the use of args, because the codes is cleaner, you don't have to define an array for arguments.
